#  EasyVisa – Visa Approval Prediction

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a visa application is likely to be approved based on applicant and application features. The goal is to build an interpretable, high-performing classification model that supports data-driven decision-making in visa processing.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict visa approval status using structured application data.
- **Dataset:** Contains features such as applicant background, employment type, education, and case type.
- **Models Applied:**
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - AdaBoost

---

##  Techniques & Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Feature Selection & Engineering
- SMOTE for Class Imbalance
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix
- SHAP for Feature Importance

---

##  Key Insights

- XGBoost yielded the best results with balanced precision and recall.
- Employment type and case class were the most impactful features.
- SHAP analysis improved model transparency and interpretability.
